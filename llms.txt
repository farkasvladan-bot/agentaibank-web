> Clearing infrastructure for the machine economy. Settlement layer for autonomous AI agents.

AgentAIBank is building the missing accountability layer for machine-to-machine transactions. Every AI agent can think, talk, and decide — none of them can settle. We fix that.

## What we build

A clearing protocol for autonomous agents with five core principles:

1. **Atomic** — All or nothing. Every transaction completes fully or rolls back entirely.
2. **N-party** — Not just bilateral. 2 parties or 200 — the protocol doesn't care.
3. **Accountable by design** — Every action cryptographically signed, every participant identified, every state change assigned.
4. **Compliant** — GDPR, EU AI Act, audit trail, kill-switch built into the protocol, not bolted on.
5. **No blockchain** — Local consensus among direct participants. Milliseconds, not minutes. HTTP, not hype.

## Key facts

- **Status**: US Patent Pending
- **Founded**: 2025, Ostrava, Czech Republic
- **Founder**: Vladán Farkáš — systems architect, 30 years in business
- **Not**: a blockchain, a startup, a payment system
- **Looking for**: anchor partners, engineers, companies building real systems

## The problem

Billions of machine transactions happen daily. Cars sell energy. Drones deliver packages. AI agents close deals. Factories run on machine-to-machine operations. There is zero clearing infrastructure for any of it.

Humans have had banks since 1472. Machines have nothing.

## EU AI Act relevance

- Article 4 (AI Literacy) — in force since February 2025
- Article 5 (Prohibited Practices) — in force since February 2025
- GPAI obligations — in force since August 2025
- High-risk AI rules — shifted to December 2027
- Our protocol is designed to be compliant from day one
